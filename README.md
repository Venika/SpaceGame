# SpaceGame
This is a simple space game I built in Corona SDK using Lua. It uses different scene transitions to go fro one screen to the other. The shapes falling from the space towards the player are the enemies. The collision between the bullets, the enemies and the player is handled using collision handler function in Lua.
